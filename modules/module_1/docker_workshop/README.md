# Project Title: NY Taxi Data Pipelines and Docker Workshop

## Description

This project provides an example of setting up a basic data engineering pipeline will ingest, transform and store in a relational database. To build the pipeline we will use data from the NY taxi site (https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) and docker images.

## Features

- Data pipeline coded using python that will ingest, transform, and store data in a Postgres database
- Docker images that will build isolated python and postgres containers



### Prerequisites

- Docker engine installed
- Python3 installed
- Preferred IDE (ex. VS Code, VS Codium)

## Getting Started

git clone repository

# Change directory to the project folder
cd repository

```bash
cd repository
docker run -it docker-image-name
```

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to the Data Engineering Zoom Camp Instructors and Data.Talks Club for providing tutorials and guidance on building real world projects.
